                    <p className="text-gray-700 lg:text-xl font-medium">Introduction</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 lg:text-xl">
                        This Data Retention Policy (the “Policy”) sets out how Agenpo retains Records (defined below) necessary for its business operations, contractual obligations, legal, audit and regulatory compliance, and when we may destroy such Records, whilst promoting orderly and efficient data management. This ensures compliance with the data protection laws and the duty of confidentiality to which we are bound. We retain your information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. The period of data storage and retention is subject to legal, regulatory, administrative and operational requirements.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Records include Information, data, documents (contractual, personal), correspondence, policies, confidential information, etc. regardless of media; created, received, and maintained by Agenpo as evidence, and in compliance with regulatory requirements, legal obligations, business practices, legal policies, contractual obligations, financial transactions, administrative activities, business decisions or other actions. Records provide information about, and evidence of Agenpo’s transactions, customers, employment and activities, and may be created, received or maintained in hard copy or electronic format.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span className="font-medium">Scope Of This Policy</span>
                        <br />
                        The main objective of this Policy is to ensure that complete and accurate Records are identified, retained, stored, protected and subsequently destroyed or archived appropriately under such terms and within such periods set out in this Policy.
                        This Policy applies to our Platform, and all related sites, applications, services and tools regardless of how they are accessed or used. It also covers all Records stored on company-owned, leased, and otherwise company-provided systems and media, regardless of location, including our servers, third-party servers; computer systems (desktops or laptops), mobile devices, physical records stored at our offices or other locations.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span className="font-medium">Policy Administrator</span>
                        <br />
                        Agenpo's Data Compliance Officer (DCO) shall oversee the administration, implementation and the procedure of this Policy. The DCO works with the company's management and legal & compliance department and shall ensure that the data retention schedule (below) is followed. The DCO has the authority to review the data retention procedures; monitor compliance; make modifications to the data retention schedule when necessary to ensure it complies with the relevant laws, encompasses new developments and contains the appropriate records and document.

                        <br />
                        In addition to other existing data protection measures being implemented by Agenpo, we will ensure that the following measures are in place to protect the security of retained Records:
                        <ol className="list-decimal text-gray-700 lg:text-xl pl-4 lg:pl-0">
                            <li>All Records received and retained through emails must be encrypted and/or password protected and will only be transmitted and stored over secure networks</li>
                            <li>All Records retained physically (in hardcopy form) will be stored in a secure container, file or folder, marked “confidential” and kept in a safe location</li>
                            <li>Records whether physical or electronic will be stored in secure folders and will not be left unattended</li>
                            <li>Computers used to retain Records will always be password protected, properly maintained, and protected from virus or unauthorized access.</li>
                            <li>Retained Records will not be stored in the personal devices of employees of the company</li>
                            <li>All Records stored electronically will be backed up periodically with back-ups stored onsite at our offices or offsite at a data center</li>
                            <li>All electronic copies of Records will be stored securely using passwords and encryption as appropriate</li>
                            <li>Records will be retained in a secure location, with limited access to authorized personnel only.</li>
                            <li>All passwords used to protect Records will be changed periodically and will be secure.</li>
                            <li>All Records retained during their specified periods will be traceable and retrievable.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span className="font-medium">Retention Period And Procedures</span>
                        <br />
                        AFor all Records obtained, used and stored by Agenpo, we will conduct periodic reviews of the Records retained, confirming their purpose, continued validity, accuracy and requirement to retain such Records. Records will be kept for as long as they are needed to meet the operational or contractual needs of Agenpo, together with legal and regulatory requirements. Agenpo may transfer paper-based Records to an alternative media format in instances of long retention periods. As a general principle, Agenpo will only need to retain one copy of the final version of a Record. Draft documents may be destroyed immediately unless they contain vital information which were not otherwise contained the final document.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The retention periods for Records provided under this Policy takes into consideration: the requirements of Agenpo for such Records; the type, sensitivity and importance of such Record; contractual obligations; the purpose of processing such record; lawful basis for processing the records; the requirements of the law. Where it is not possible to define a statutory or legal retention period in line with the applicable data protection/privacy laws, we will identify the criteria by which the period can be determined (such as industry standards) and update this Policy as may be necessary.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Records must be categorized by purpose and retained for specific periods in accordance with the Retention Schedule below. Retained Records will be grouped by category and in a clear date order when the Record was stored and/or archived. Notwithstanding the retention periods provided in the retention schedule below, Records which are subject of, or required in any pending litigation, investigation or other regulatory process shall not be destroyed or altered, until the completion of such process.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span className="font-medium">Destruction Of Records</span>
                        <br />
                        Destruction of Records is a critical component of our data retention policy. Once the retention period has elapsed, the Records are either reviewed, archived, returned, anonymized or confidentially destroyed depending on their purpose, importance and legal requirements. When a Record has reached its designated destruction date, the DCO shall refer to the retention register to determine the next action to be taken. Not all data or records are expected to be deleted upon expiration; sometimes it is sufficient to anonymize the data, return the Record or to archive Records for a further period.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Records will not be kept after the retention period unless:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ol className="list-decimal text-gray-700 lg:text-xl pl-4 lg:pl-0">
                            <li>The Record is the subject of a pending litigation, administrative or regulatory proceedings. In these circumstances, destruction will be delayed until such regulatory proceedings have been completed, at which time a new retention period will be created.</li>
                            <li>The Record has long-term value for Agenpo's statutory or regulatory obligations</li>
                            <li>Agenpo determines that such Record will be permanently stored, provided that no legal, regulatory or contractual breach will occur by the permanent retention of such record.</li>
                            <li>There is a legal or regulatory reason or order to maintain the Records either permanently or for a longer period.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Agenpo is committed to the secure and safe disposal of any Record in accordance with our contractual and legal obligations. Accordingly, when the Records have been retained until the end of their retention period, they can be destroyed in the following ways:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ol className="list-decimal text-gray-700 lg:text-xl pl-4 lg:pl-0">
                            <li>Hardcopy of documents will be destroyed by shredding or burning</li>
                            <li>Non-sensitive information can be thrown in a normal trash bin and properly disposed.</li>
                            <li>Non-sensitive information can be thrown in a normal trash bin and properly disposed</li>
                            <li>Electronic Records will be deleted/erased and cleared from recycle bins, the cloud and other back-up systems it has been saved to</li>
                            <li>Electronic equipment or systems containing Records will be destroyed. Where a specific Record is stored in one single media such as a CD Rom and cannot be erased, such media used to store the Record will be physically destroyed. However, where the media contains other Records which are not due for deletion, and it is impossible to separately erase such Record due for deletion, the retention period shall be extended to such period when all the Records in that media are due for deletion/destruction, and Agenpo shall either format or physically destroy the media.</li>
                            <li>Destruction of electronic Records should render them non-recoverable even using forensic data recovery techniques</li>
                        </ol>
